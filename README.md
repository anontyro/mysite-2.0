# My Site 2.0
This is a complete rebuilding of my own site using a full Typescript stack with NextJS on the frontend running with an Express server powering GraphQL. The idea was to rebuild my site in a more flexiable way using TypeScript technologies that provide
an easy to extend base that will be used in a whole host of applications I create.

The idea with putting a GraphQL backend was to aim to unify all my endpoints and databases making for a much nicer interface for me to work with.

I wanted to experiment with NextJS to see how it would work compared to the normal create-react-app
